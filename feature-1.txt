Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

You can use the inline style attribute or the <style> element to change the text color and then set the value using the color property. The color property sets the foreground color value for an element's text and text decoration. The color property accepts HTML color names, RGB, RGBA, HEX, HSL, or HSLA values.
